# Troubleshooting

Here you will find the required documentation to resolve technical errors and implement alternative solutions.

## No Matching Key: Error

//TODO
## Process is undefined, Buffer is undefined or global is undefined errors

These errors appear when some global variable that the library is using are not defined in your working environment.
 This can be fixed by adding some polyfills in your js file before importing modal packages.

```ts
import { Buffer } from 'buffer'

if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  if (!window.Buffer) {
    window.Buffer = Buffer // Fixes Buffer is undefined error
  }
  if (!window.global) {
    window.global = window // Fixes global is undefined error
  }
  if (!window.process) {
    window.process = { env: {} } // Fixes process is undefined error
  }
}
```

## Integrating Wagmi with Angular

**Angular and Wagmi have a typescript compatibility issue due to the use of different versions.**

- If you're having trouble when trying to install WalletConnect's SDKs you can run the installation using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag:

Example:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @web3modal/ethereum @web3modal/html @wagmi/core viem --legacy-peer-deps
```

- If you are facing typescript errors during compilation when trying to run your project, make sure you add `“SkipLibCheck”: true` to the tsconfig.json file.

## In Next.js the QR Code doesn’t work in production, but it works in development

We've found that relatively old Next.js version will have some compatibility issues when using SWC to build your project. In this case we 
recommend updating your project's Next version to the latest or disabling the `SWCMinify` flag in your `next.config.js`.

## Does my project need to be verified and approved before using WalletConnect SDKs?
No, the Project ID is  pre-verified when created. You can have your project in Draft state and still use your ID without any inconvenient.

## Introduction

The Web3Modal SDK allows you to easily connect your Web3 dapp with wallets. It provides a simple and
intuitive interface for dapps to request actions such as signing transactions and interacting with smart
contracts on the blockchain. The SDK is designed to work with any blockchain, making it easy to support
multiple chains without the need for separate integration code.

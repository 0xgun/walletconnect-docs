## Overview

Web3Modal SDK integrates Magic SDK with your application to enable passwordless Web3 onboarding (no seed phrases) and authentication using magic links (similar to Slack and Medium).
It enables blazing-fast, hardware-secured, passwordless login, Web3 onboarding, and access to over 20 blockchains with a few lines of code â€” even if you have an existing auth solution.
